# GSEABenchmarkeR 1.6.0

* New function `evalTypeIError` for type I error rate evalution by sample permutation:
  - evaluation of one or more enrichment methods on one ore more expression datasets
  - support for splitting permutations into blocks of defined size, and invoking 
    parallel evaluation of the partitions 
    
* New function `evalRandomGS` for evaluation of random gene sets:
  - estimates proportion of rejected null hypotheses (= fraction of significant 
    gene sets) of an enrichment method when applied to random gene sets of defined size
  - evaluation of one or more enrichment methods on an expression dataset of choice

* New argument `method` to the `evalRelevance` function for the evaluation
  of phenotype relevance of gene set rankings, choices include:
  - "wsum": computes a weighted sum of the relevance scores (default),
  - "auc": performs a ROC/AUC analysis based on the ROCR package,
  - "cor": computes a standard correlation measure such as Spearman's rank correlation,
  - a user-defined function for customized behaviors.

* New argument `se` to the `compRand` function for assessing the significance of
  an observed relevance score based on randomized gene set rankings:

* metaFC

* exploratory plots plotDEDistribution and plotNrSamples

* Extended support for user-defined benchmarking inputs:
