Description:
    The GSEABenchmarkeR package implements an extendable framework for the
    reproducible evaluation of set- and network-based methods for the enrichment
    analysis of gene expression data. This includes support for the efficient
    execution of these methods on comprehensive real data compendia (microarray
    and RNA-seq) using parallel computation on standard workstations as well as
    institutional computer grids. Methods can then be assessed with respect to
    runtime, statistical significance, and relevance of the results for the
    investigated phenotypes.
